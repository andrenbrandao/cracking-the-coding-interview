"""
Problem:

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE

Input:  "Mr John Smith    ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

Hints: #53, #118

--

Algorithm:

- Go from right to left on the string searching for spaces. Start from the length - 1.
- When we find a space, shift all the characters to the right by 2 places.
- Increment the length of the string by 2.
- On the empty space, add the %20 characters
- Repeat until we have read all characters of the string.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) because we have to shift all characters to the right
for every new space.
